Leverages the `<input>` + `<datalist>` element combo.

- `<input list="DATALISTID">`
- `<datalist id="DATALISTID">`

::: tip
Think of `<datalist>` as a list of _suggested_ values.

- `<select>` only allows you to choose between its provided values.
- `<input>` lets you input anything you want.
- `<input>` + `<datalist>` is a hybrid between the two.
