Leverages the `<input>` + `<datalist>` element combo.

- `<input list="DATALISTID">`
- `<datalist id="DATALISTID">`

Think of `<datalist>` as a list of _suggested_ values. `<select>` only allows you to choose between its provided values, and `<input>` lets you write anything you want. `<datalist>` is a hybrid between the two.
