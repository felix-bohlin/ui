#### 1. Use the latest Chromium version with web API feature flags enabled

While many components will work as intended in modern browsers - some are using features that haven't landed outside Chromium with experimental feature flags enabled. I personally use Brave, but any Chromium browser should do.

#### 2. Install Open Props

Open Props v2 hasn't dropped yet, which is why this project relies on the OPv2 beta. The difference right now between the OPv1 and the OPv2 beta aren't huge (the way OPUI consumes it), so you should be fine with either version.

#### 3. Copy and paste the components you need to your project
